In addition to ways stated elsewhere in the rules, the speaker may leave the post in two ways:

- By distributing a message stating that ey are resigning the post; or
- By a vote of no confidence from the voters.

If any voter believes that the speaker is negligent in eir duty they may distribute a message to all players declaring that they have no confidence in the speaker. Each voter may then vote by distributing their vote to all players. At the end of the normal voting period, if 50% or more voters have unanimously voted in favour, the speaker is removed from eir post.

A new speaker is randomly chosen from amongst the players with the largest number of points by any mutally agreed method. All these players are declared to have won, and the game is restarted as described in rule 203.

The first duty of the new speaker shall be to impose a punishment on the old speaker for neglecting eir duties. This may comprise of being banned from the game for a period of up to 20 working days, or 5 game rounds, whichever is less. (Each game round ends whenever a winner, or set of winners, is declared.) They may also impose a fine no greater than 10 points on the speaker, imposed on them when they rejoin the game.

The second duty of the new speaker shall be to gather any private game data (e.g. votes) held by the previous speaker. The old speaker should pass this along to the new speaker. Players should keep a record of any private information they send to the speaker, and be prepared to send a copy to the new speaker. In the event that votes cannot be recovered this way, the new speaker should tell all players that votes have been lost, and restart the voting period on any affected proposals.
