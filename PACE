PACE:

Any game action any player performs by notifying the speaker, except voting, may - at the discretion of the speaker - be deferred by the speaker until the following Friday.(1)

Actions may not be re-ordered: if this deferral would cause other actions to happen before the deferred action, those other actions must also be deferred.

If that Friday is a non-working day, or the speaker is indisposed that day, the speaker may (and should) defer until the preceding Thursday instead, by making an announcement before 6pm, UK time on the preceding Monday.

If the speaker is unexpectedly indisposed on any Friday, any actions due to be executed that day may be deferred instead to happen at a later date.

Voting is always considered to have happened at the time given by the timestamp on the message sent to the speaker.

1. To be clear: an action performed on Friday 1st may be deferred until Friday 8th.

[[Non-proposal notes: this will allow the speaker to do one big update every Friday, instead of trying to track the game in real time. It also has allowances for bank holidays, speaker illness, etc...]]
